# Real-Time Machine Learning Model Monitoring for Banking Fraud Detection: A Micro-Batch Approach with Evidently AI
This project develops and evaluates two monitoring tools for Machine Learning models used in fraud detection, one using **full-batch** approach and one using **micro-batch** approach to approximate **real-time monitoring**.  
The project uses the **Evidently AI** framework and Random Forest models to detect **data drift** in transaction streams.

## Features
- Full-batch and micro-batch drift monitoring of fraud detection models
- Early detection of data drift affecting critical fraud features
- Evaluation of how drift correlates with model precision and recall
- CI/CD pipeline integration for automated deployment
- Statistical correlation analysis between drift and performance degradation
